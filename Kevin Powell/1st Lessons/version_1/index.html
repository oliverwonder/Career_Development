            <h2>What is Bouldering</h2>
            <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.</p>
            <p>Unlike <a href="">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>
            <p>Experience the perfect blend of physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving as you navigate routes close to the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination. Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts.</p>
            <h2>Why Bouldering?</h2>
            <p>Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced athlete, climbers of all ages can challenge themselves, celebrate each other's successes, and build lasting friendships.</p>
